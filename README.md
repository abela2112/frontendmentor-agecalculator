## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

- [tailwindcss]([(https://tailwindcss.com/)] - For styles



### What I learned

from this project i learn a lot about css framework tailwindcss. i learn how to add custom css class to add  tailwind and also i learn how to work with dates in javascript


```
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {

    return new Date(year, month, 0).getDate()
  
}
```

### Continued development

i want to know more about  tailwindcss and  react

### Useful resources

- [MDN web docs]([(https://developer.mozilla.org/))] - This helped me for date reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
